## Mission: Make Pizza AI-Ready

## overview:
This project demonstrate how a traditional pizza API can be made usable by AI agents through
## Model Context Protocol(MCP).

Instead of building a new backend logic to a specific LLM, the system converts an OpenAPI specification in to a MCP server
and then proves real-world usability through mutliple co-operating agents.
