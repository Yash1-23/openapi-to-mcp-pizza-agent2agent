## Mission: Make Pizza AI-Ready

## overview:
This project demonstrate how a traditional pizza API can be made usable by AI agents through
Model Context Protocol(MCP).

Instead of building a new backend logic to a specific LLM, the system converts an OpenAPI specification in to a MCP server
and then proves real-world usability through mutliple co-operating agents.

## Problem Statement:
AI agent is becoming the new interface for users.
Traditional APIs are not directly interact with agents untless they are exposed through a prtocol that supports dicoverability, tool execution, and structured context.

The goal of this project is too:

1.Automatically  translate the OpenAPI specifications into MCP servers.

2.Make pizza APIs accessible to AI agents.

3.Demonstrate agent cooperation through a real world ordering and scheduling workflow like it works as Agent-to-Agent workflow.
